# Iris-Flowers-Classification-ML-Project

This is my first ML Project and I've used the dataset to implement the Naive Bayes Classification Model so as to get my first Hands-on
experience.The project includes the use of of Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Data Visualization Libraries.
The dataset contains 3 classes or Iris Species with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: 
Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

At the end, a Confusion Matrix is created and the accuracy of the model is checked.
